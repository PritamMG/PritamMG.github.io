<li><br/>Generalized Points-to Graphs: A New Abstraction of Memory in Presence of Pointers</li>
<br>
<li><a class="text6">What is that?</a> <br>
<li><br/> A new form of bottom-up procedure summaries, called the generalized points-to graphs (GPGs) for a precise and scalable 
    flow- and context-sensitive points-to analysis.
</li>
<br>
<li><a class="text6">More details</a> <br>
<li><p>GPGs can represent both memory transformers that summarize the effect of a procedure and
the resulting memory in terms of points-to relations. A GPG contains GPUs (generalized points-to updates)
representing individual memory updates along with the control flow between them.</p>
<p>A GPG
views points-to relations as memory updates and generalizes them using the counts of indirection levels leaving the unknown
pointees implicit. GPGs are
compact; their compactness is achieved by a careful choice of a suitable representation and a series
of optimizations: strength reduction reduces the indirection levels, redundancy elimination removes
redundant memory updates and minimizes control flow (without over-approximating data dependence between memory updates), 
and call inlining enhances the opportunities of these optimizations. </p>
<p>
We devise novel
operations such as GPU composition and GPU reduction and data flow analyses such as reaching GPUs analysis and coalescing analysis 
for these optimizations. These optimizations are 
similar to the optimizations performed by compilers. <p/>
<p>Essentially, these optimizations
eliminate the data dependence between memory updates by rewriting the memory updates thereby
discarding redundant control flow whenever possible.
The picture below describes the various abstractions, operations, analyses, and optimizations used along with their dependences
between each other.</p>
